This project aimed at improving the learned named entity (NER) tags with the help of relation extraction (RE) between the named entities.

Dataset for training NER models : CoNLL
Two models Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) were implemented to predict NER tags. CRF model performed better than HMM in this task.

Dataset for training RE model : IJCNLP2011 New York Times
The learned named entities were then fed to Maximum Entropy model to learn relationship between them. The learned relation was then used to refine the NER tags.

Tools used : Python, CRF++, MaxEnt Toolkit
